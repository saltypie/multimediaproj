        <div class="subheading" id="">World War 2</div>
        <p>The USA's operation iceberg planned to capture Okinawa as a stage for mainland invasion. On April 1945 forces began landing, fighting lasted 82 days with allied losses of ~12,000 and civilian losses of ~100,000(half the island's population). The Japanese military forced and coerced locals, children and elderly alike to commit suicide attacks against American forces. Anecdotes from Okinawan historians also detail atrocities such as rape by the American forces.</p>
